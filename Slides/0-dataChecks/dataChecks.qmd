# Data Validation Process 

## Data Validation Process {.smaller}

- Data validation entails the assessment and verification of data quality, accuracy, and reliability, thereby supporting informed decision-making.

- Within World Justice Project (WJP), we have identified three distinct processes where these data checks are utilized:

    - The data cleaning process.
    - The estimation of results.
    - The analysis of results.
    
- Currently, our focus lies on developing protocols for the analysis of results.

## Data cleaning process {.smaller}

- The data cleaning process involves utilizing data validation to ensure the reliability of observations.

- In the case of WJP, specific variables are included and cross-referenced with external sources and the Rule of Law Index to ensure data consistency and reliability.

- Challenges: 

    - What level of analysis will be used for data checking? Will it be at the country level or the NUTS level?
    - Is the process of comparison with external sources necessary in the cleaning process? With which sources would it be compared?

## Estimations of results {.smaller}

- The estimation process involves data validation using two approaches: replication checks and data consistency assessment.

- Replication checks: Every estimated data point is independently replicated by another data analyst to ensure accuracy and reliability.

- Data consistency assessment: Observations that lead to significant changes are meticulously reviewed, especially in the case of expert surveys. Additionally, aggregate responses from population surveys are assessed to ensure data consistency.

- Challenges:

    - Determining the selection of appropriate third-party sources for data estimation and assessment.
    - Identifying the specific stages of the process where data analytics can intervene to enhance the overall process.

## Analysis of results {.smaller}

- After gathering all the results to be included, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive validation of these findings.

- The variations among the results are carefully examined to detect any biases or inaccuracies in any given country.

- The results are then compared with other sources to ensure their consistency and reliability.

- Challenges:

    - Can the questions be cross-referenced with the specified NUTS regions?
    - If we decide to aggregate the scores by country, how should we determine the weighting of each component?
    - How should we address situations where external data for certain sub-pillars is unavailable for comparison?

# Analysis of Results

# Introduction

## Introduction {.smaller}

\

\


- The protocol primarily focuses on validating the results obtained, rather than directly validating the quality of the underlying data.

- This protocol serves as a rigorous quantitative complement and a valuable tool for post-estimation validations.

    - **It does not replace the checks conducted by researchers.**

# Methodology

## Methodology  {.smaller}

\

\


- These methodologies validate WJP Global Index results and reports for Latin America and the Caribbean.

- Quantitative methods detect data changes and discrepancies with other sources.

- They complement qualitative research but do not replace it.

- Methodologies evaluate results, not data collection process.

- Two types of methodologies: internal and external validations.

## Internal and External Validations {.smaller}

- Internal validations: These checks provide confidence in the data quality, ensuring it is representative, consistent, and free from distortions or biases.

    - Outliers' detection
    
    - Changes over time
    
- External validations: These checks provide valuable insights into the validity and credibility of the project results, ensuring they are in line with established standards and corroborated by independent measures

    - Rankings and other indexes
    
    - Third party sources questions

## Internal Validations {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Outliers' detection

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Outliers represent data points that significantly deviate from most observations.

- Detecting outliers during internal data validation ensures the dataset is representative, consistent, and free from anomalies, enabling more reliable and robust analysis.

- The step by step approach to applying the method is here: Outliers' detection.

### Changes over time

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Monitoring changes over time helps detect data anomalies and highlights events that may have caused significant fluctuations or alterations.

- This monitoring will employ two approaches to identify changes over time: conducting t-tests and analyzing trends.

- The step by step approach to applying the method is here: Changes over time.

## External Validations {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Rankings and other indexes

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

- This comparative analysis will help determine if countries' results and ranking order based on their scores align with other sources that aim to measure similar concepts.

- We will establish thresholds of 3%, 5%, and 10% above or below their respective positions.

### Third-party sources questions 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

- To provide a more precise comparison between external and internal data, a set of comparable questions will be selected, and the results will be compared at the country level.

- The objective is to obtain microdata for testing internal and external data consistency through a mean difference test. If microdata is unavailable, differences exceeding thresholds of 3%, 5%, and 10% will be highlighted.

# Projects

## Projects {.smaller}

- WJP Rule of Law Index

    - The Index Team has devised a protocol to validate the data and    results for 140 countries worldwide. This protocol contains some of     the methodologies presented.
    
- Latin America and the Caribbean Reports

    - In the case of reports focusing on Latin America and the Caribbean, validations were conducted at the question level, employing most of the methodologies presented.

- European Union Subnational Project

    - The Data Analytics Team proposes a harmonized data validation approach for the European Union report, combining methodologies used in both the index and the reports.

# EU Subnational Project Proposal

## EU Subnational Project {.smaller}

- EU subnational project aims to generate indicators for assessing justice, governance, and the rule of law in 110 regions across 27 EU member states.

- Three resources (QRQ, GPP, third-party sources) utilized to develop indicators for NUTS and country-level scores.

- Comparing results with other sources is crucial for reliability and confidence assessment.

- Data Analytics Unit implements a protocol integrating methodologies to validate and compare project outputs.

- The protocol complements qualitative checks, ensuring accuracy, identifying inconsistencies, and instilling confidence in the obtained results.


## Integrated Process of Validation {.smaller}

- At pillar level

    - An examination of outliers at the NUTS level for each pillar.
    - A comparison of the aggregated pillar scores by country with rankings from external sources relevant to the respective pillar.
    
- At sub-pillar level

    - An assessment of outliers at the NUTS level for each sub-pillar.
    - Whenever possible, a comparison of the aggregated sub-pillar scores by country with rankings from external sources associated with the specific sub-pillar.
    - An analysis of changes in the selected questions over time within each sub-pillar.
    - A comparison of the questions with external sources.

## Possible Outcomes {.smaller}

- Insights report

    - We plan to generate a comprehensive report highlighting the key insights from this analysis. 
    - This report will include the decisions made and recommendations regarding the outcomes. 

- Web platform to test the outcomes

    - We will design an application that facilitates the external and internal testing of all outcomes on a country-specific basis.
    - This app will integrate qualitative checks and display all the flags associated with each pillar and sub-pillar within the platform.

## Resources {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Resources

- WJP Rule of Law Index Team 

    - The WJP ROLI Team has identified several sources to compare for the estimations. We will add most of them for the ranking analysis.

- [Catalog](https://wjproject.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/research/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B441FF86C-0ED3-4533-BA07-4F0A38EF3881%7D&file=EUS%20Indicator%20Catalog.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

    - The catalog is a tool for identifying questions from other European surveys, encompassing approximately 2800 questions organized by sub-pillar and pillar.

### Catalog 

- Each pillar consists of over 300 indicators/questions, with the first pillar having the most indicators and the sixth pillar having the fewest.

- The catalog does not include any indicators for sub-pillars 6.4-6.8, 7.5-7.6, and 8.6.

- Sub-pillars 2.3, 7.4, and 8.2 have fewer than 10 indicators/questions available in the catalog.

- Subnational questions account for less than 7% of the total questions across all pillars. Pillar 7 has the fewest number of questions, with only 1, while pillar 2 has the highest number with 24.
